# ... edit files ...

# 4. Stage changes
git add .
# or specific files: git add src/specific_file.py

# 5. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "✨ Add new feature: Description of what you added"

# 6. Continue development...
```

### **Commit Message Conventions:**
```bash

```

## 🔀 **Merging to Main Branch:**

### **When to Merge:**
- ✅ Feature is complete and tested
- ✅ No known bugs in development branch
- ✅ Ready for production release
- ✅ All tests pass (if applicable)

### **Merge Process:**
```bash
# 1. Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Merge development branch
git merge development

# 3. Tag the release (optional)
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release v2.1.0: New features and improvements"

# 4. Switch back to development for continued work
git checkout development
```

## 📋 **Common Git Commands:**

### **Branch Management:**
```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Switch to development branch
git checkout development

# Create new feature branch (if needed)
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
```

### **Status and History:**
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# View detailed history
git log --graph --oneline --all

# View changes in files
git diff
```

### **Staging and Committing:**
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Stage specific file
git add src/specific_file.py

# Commit staged changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Stage and commit in one command
git commit -am "Your commit message"
```

### **Undoing Changes:**
```bash
# Unstage files (before commit)
git reset HEAD filename

# Discard changes in working directory
git checkout -- filename

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes) - BE CAREFUL!
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices:**

- ✅ **Use emojis** for visual categorization
- ✅ **Present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

### **Branch Usage:**
- ✅ **Development branch** for all new work
- ✅ **Main branch** only for stable releases
- ✅ **Feature branches** for major new features (optional)

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **For Immediate Development:**
```bash
# You're already on development branch
# Start making changes for next features
# Commit regularly with descriptive messages
```

### **Example Development Session:**
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch
# * development

## 💡 **Tips for Beginners:**

1. **Always check current branch**: `git branch`
2. **Check status before committing**: `git status`
3. **Use descriptive commit messages**
4. **Commit often, merge when stable**
5. **Don't be afraid to experiment** (you can always undo)

## 🆘 **Emergency Commands:**

```bash
# If you're lost, check where you are
git status
git branch

# If you made changes on wrong branch
git stash          # Save changes temporarily
git checkout development  # Switch to correct branch
git stash pop      # Restore changes

# If you need to discard all changes
git reset --hard HEAD  # BE CAREFUL - this discards everything!
```
