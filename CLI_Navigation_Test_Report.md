## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Space Toggle Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Space key not toggling selections in multi-select menus  
**Root Cause**: Pre-selected items (`menu.selected_items = ["NSE_EQ", "BSE_EQ"]`) causing confusion  
**Solution**: Changed to `menu.selected_items = []` to start with clean slate  
**Test Result**: Space toggle now works perfectly

### 2. Multiple Key Press Handling ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple consecutive keys (e.g., "ssss") showing "Invalid command"  
**Root Cause**: No handling for repeated characters  
**Solution**: Added logic to detect and normalize repeated characters  
**Code Fix**:
```python
if command and len(command) > 1 and len(set(command)) == 1:
    command = command[0]
```
**Test Result**: "ssss" now correctly processed as "s"

### 3. Arrow Key Navigation ✅ VERIFIED
**Status**: Working correctly with rich terminal mode enabled  
**Implementation**: Proper escape sequence parsing with timeout optimization  
**Fallback**: w/s keys work when arrow keys unavailable  
**Performance**: Reduced timeout from 0.1s to 0.05s for better responsiveness

### 4. Terminal Input Hanging ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: CLI interface hanging on launch  
**Root Cause**: `os.system('clear')` causing system call hang  
**Solution**: Replaced with ANSI escape codes `print('\033[2J\033[H', end='', flush=True)`  
**Additional**: Added scrollback buffer clearing for better performance

---

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### 1. Terminal Input Handling
- Reduced escape sequence timeout from 0.1s to 0.05s
- Added proper output flushing with `flush=True`
- Optimized screen clearing with ANSI codes

### 2. Menu Rendering
- Enhanced clear screen function with scrollback buffer clearing
- Improved visual feedback responsiveness
- Optimized print statement buffering

### 3. Input Processing
- Better handling of multiple key presses
- Improved command normalization
- Enhanced error handling
